                At Junior School, we set high academic standards while nurturing the love for learning.
                Students deepen their understanding of core subjects, while developing advanced skills in research,
                analysis, and critical thinking. Our teaching approach at this stage is inquiry-driven, which
                promoting curiosity and independent thinking across all disciplines.

                to build confidence, overcome challenges, and achieve their personal best.

        We introduce students to career awareness through project-based learning, workshops, and mentorship programmes.
        Early exposure to different fields inspires students to think about their futures and equips them with
