            Karuguru Junior Academy School is a well-established learning institution in Kiambu County, Kenya.
            It has grown over the years to become one of the leading schools in the region that provides quality 
            education to learners from different backgrounds.

            <h5 class="text-uppercase text-center fw-bold" style="color: #a71d2a">Founding of the School</h5>
            <p class="fs-5">
                The school was established in the year 2006 by Rev. Samuel Ndungu. It started as a primary school with only
                one classroom (3 students and 2 teachers.)

            <h5 class="text-uppercase text-center fw-bold" style="color: #a71d2a">Early Development</h5>
            <p class="fs-5">
                In its early years, the school faced many challenges, such as a lack of water, a lack of classrooms 
                and toilets, and a lack of enough capital for development. Despite this, the commitment of the staff
                and support from the local community helped the school grow. The first head teacher was Lydia Mumbe,
                who was key in setting the foundation for discipline and academic excellence.

            <h5 class="text-uppercase text-center fw-bold" style="color: #a71d2a">Growth and Achievements</h5>
            <p class="fs-5">
                Over the years, the school expanded its infrastructure by building more classes, dormitories, and
                laboratories. It has also introduced new programs such as computer classes, school clubs, and sports.
