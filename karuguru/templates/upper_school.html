                In the upper school, we provide an inspiring environment where 
                students in Grades 4 to 6 are empowered to grow into confident, capable learners.
                This critical stage bridges childhood and adolescence, and we are committed to nurturing 
                academic excellence, personal responsibility, and leadership potential in every child.
                Our holistic approach ensures that students continue to feel supported, challenged, and motivated
                to reach their full potential.

                We welcome students into Grades 4, 5, and 6, offering a flexible and supportive environment 
                tailored to meet the evolving needs of pre-adolescent learners. Our Upper School acts as a transition
                point between foundational learning in lower primary and the demands of secondary school, 
                helping students develop the skills and confidence necessary for future academic success.

            <p class="mt-4 text-secondary" style="max-width: 100%; text-align: left; line-height: 1.6;">
                Learning in the Upper School is driven by curiosity, inquiry, and increasingly independent thought. 
                Our teachers provide a balance of structured academic instruction and experiential learning opportunities,
                encouraging students to ask questions, explore topics in depth, and collaborate with their peers. 
                We value critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving, equipping students with essential skills
                for the future.

                The curriculum is broad and stimulating, offering a rich combination of core academic subjects 
                and specialist disciplines. Students engage deeply with English, Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies,
                while also exploring ICT, Visual Arts, Performing Arts, and Physical Education. We place strong 
                emphasis on literacy, numeracy, research skills, and project-based learning, fostering well-rounded 
                intellectual development.
